1) on Eclipse, create a project for SimpDiscur (java 1.8), copy the src code
2) on Eclipse, create a project for SemgrexAlector (java 1.8), copy the src code, and link the project to the .jars in the lib folder and the junit.
3) on Eclipse, create a project for RulesCompiler, copy the src code, and link the project to the java-cup.jar and jflex-full.jar in the lib folder.
4) add the SemgrexAlector in the required projects of the RulesCompiler project.
5) add the SemgrexAlector and RulesCompiler in the required projects of the SimpDiscur project.
6) add the java-cup.jar in the SimpDiscur project
7) in the Simplifier.java:
7a) set the syntactic rules in the "rule = new SynSimpUsingExternalFiles" if you want to use transfromation rules from external files.
7b) set the lexical reosuces in the resources variable
7c) set the input files in the parsed. Here you put only the parsed files (.conll)
7d) set the path to the corefcorpus. In case of you aren't using coreference set corefcorpus = null;
7d1) the file with the coreference information need to contain the information of all files (7c)
7d2) the link between coreference and conll file is done by using the coreference file. The "#begin document" has to be followed by the name of the file plus "_000". For example, the 07_CE1_litt_orig_mousquetaires.conll file is linked to the coreferences after the line "#begin document ge:07_CE1_litt_orig_mousquetaires.conll_000"
